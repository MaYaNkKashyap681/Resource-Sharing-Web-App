# Study Material Repository

This is a web-based study material repository built using Express, Node.js, and TypeScript. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and utilizes the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm. The application allows users to upload and download study materials in various formats such as PDFs, Word documents, images, and links to online resources. The materials can be organized based on categories such as subject or grade level, and users can search for resources using the name of the resource or category.

## Installation

To get started with the Study Material Repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd study-material-repo
```

3. Install the dependencies using npm:

```shell
npm install
```

4. Build the TypeScript code:

```shell
npm run build
```

5. Start the server:

```shell
npm start
```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

Please note that you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine to run the Study Material Repository.

## Tech Stack

The Study Material Repository is built using the following technologies:

- **Express**: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Other Libraries and Tools**: The project might utilize additional libraries and tools for specific functionalities, such as file upload handling or database integration.

## Architecture and Design

The Study Material Repository follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which separates the application logic into three components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- **View**: Handles the presentation and rendering of the user interface.
- **Controller**: Manages the flow of data between the model and view, handling user requests and coordinating the application's behavior.

The application also utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to organize and structure the codebase, making use of classes, objects, and inheritance to encapsulate and modularize functionality.

Please note that the project's architecture and design might evolve as the application grows and new requirements emerge.

By leveraging Express, Node.js, TypeScript, and adhering to the MVC architecture and OOP paradigm, the Study Material Repository aims to provide a scalable and maintainable solution for managing and sharing study materials.
